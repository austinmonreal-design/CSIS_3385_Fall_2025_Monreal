Reflection on Project 3

First and foremost the most critical change I made to the form was its method. Currently posted
was DELETE, which completely defeats the purpose of a user creation submission form. So I changed
it to POST, in order to post the new user info.

Following this I considered what validation rules to apply by considering types that needed to be
added. I added letter for username, password for password, number for age, and email for email. I 
figure since these are the inputs I changed to required, it made most sense to ensure their
validation.

The most pressing security issue I puzzled over was the message field. I knew this was the most
dangerous point for the form, as if not carefully handled it could be utilized for cross site
scripting. My research into HTML suggests that it cannot be utilized to create a word limit.
To overcome this limitation and ensure a more secure message field, I decided to focus on 
a character limit instead. Similar to the limits I placed on other inputs, I used maxlength
to set a character limit of 333, more than enough to handle ten words the user might input,
while still limiting the characters enough to prevent an injection by a threat actor.
